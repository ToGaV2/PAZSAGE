3. Results


      The three investigated sites showed signiﬁcant differences in plant

biomass and soil temperature, whereas they did not differ in plant cover

(Table 1, Fig. S1). The solar park had a higher biomass than the ungrazed

and grazed sites, which did not differ from each other (Table 1, Fig. S1).

Average temperature was highest in the grazed site, lowest in the solar

park, and intermediate in the ungrazed site. Signiﬁcant differences were

found for plant height, which was higher in the solar park than in the

grazed site, and for soil bulk density, which was lower in the solar park

than in the grazed site (Table 1, Fig. S1).

      Ten species of tenebrionids were collected (Fig. 2, Table S1). Three

species (Blaps femoralis [Fischer von Waldheim, 1844], Microdera kraatzi

[Reitter, 1889] and Anatolica amoenula [Reitter, 1889]) represented

together 94% of the collected individuals (Fig. 2); separately, they

represented 45%, 37% and 12% of the overall abundance, respectively
