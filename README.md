# PAZSAGE
PApers in Zotero Summarizer, Audio Generator, &amp; Enabler

This program ingests .RIS backup files generated by Zotero reference management software then generates both a text summary and an audio summary for each publication. The summaries are generated using an openrouter.ai api key (costs about $0.02 per research paper). Audio summaries are generated on your machine using the open source Kokoro model (output in .wav format). This repo includes a .ris file and 3/4 of the associated papers as a demo mode. To run the demo just add your apikey to the GUI and hit start.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.12
- Zotero .ris backup file
- Exported reference files somewhere on your computer
- Openrouter.ai API key (sign in, give them $1, get an api key)

## Recommended Hardware/Software:
- Works on M1 or newer Apple silicon
- Built using python 3.12
- (Would love to hear about other configurations where this works)

## Mac Installation instructions (open a command prompt and type the following):
- git clone https://github.com/ToGaV2/PAZSAGE  
- cd PAZSAGE
- python3 -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- pip install --upgrade pip
- pip install -r 'requirements.txt'
- deactivate

## Run the Program (open command prompt, and cd to the program folder)
- source .venv/bin/activate
- python pazsage.py
- *** GUI Will Open. Complete this on the GUI *** --> Add ris file location, journal files location, your key, and start the process.
- *** You can watch the progress on the command line ***
- *** When complete, close the GUI or hit "CNTL + C" on the command line ***
- *** close the command prompt or type 'deactivate' to disable the venv ***

P.S. Thank you to both Cerebras.ai and OpenRouter.ai for hosting the hackathon May 24, 2025 where this idea was fleshed out.
